# pong
Blitz Basic versions of the classic Pong game written as a challenge to myself to see how few lines would be needed for a fully functioning version of the game.

Versions include Pong in 51 lines, 33 lines, 27 lines and 25 lines. These are written with just one command per line (I considered it cheating to inlcude more than a single command on a line)
